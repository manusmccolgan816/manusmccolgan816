Hi, I'm Manus, a Software Engineering student at the University of Stirling, scheduled to graduate in 2023.

I love developing in Java, C# and Kotlin, and I'm enjoying learning a bit of AI using Python.

Iâ€™m currently working on an Android app called LightWeight, a workout tracker and training cycle planner.
Recent projects include a group project simulating an aircraft management system and a scalable 2D platform game in Java.
